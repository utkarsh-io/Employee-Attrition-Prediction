# HR Analytics and Employee Attrition Prediction

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop Machine Learning models that predict employee attrition. By analyzing employee performance and various factors contributing to attrition, businesses can take proactive measures to improve employee retention and optimize workforce management.

## About the Project
In this project, I implemented various Machine Learning algorithms to predict employee attrition. I also used data visualization techniques to analyze employee performance and identify key factors affecting attrition. The predictive insights generated from this analysis can help organizations develop strategies to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **IBM Employee Attrition Dataset**, which contains various employee-related attributes such as age, job role, salary, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and more. This dataset helps in identifying patterns and trends that contribute to employee attrition.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used data visualization techniques to gain insights into employee behavior and attrition patterns.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified important features contributing to employee attrition.
- **Model Development:** Implemented Logistic Regression
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
Achieved good accuracy in predicting employee attrition using **Logistic Regression**, which performed effectively in identifying employees at risk of leaving the organization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Machine Learning in predicting employee attrition. The insights obtained can help HR departments make data-driven decisions to improve employee engagement and retention strategies.
